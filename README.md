# CS217_Project

Point cloud registration is the process of finding a transformation to align two geometric point sets. A classic algorithm to achieve this goal is called Iterative Closest Point (ICP). Since the ICP algorithm can be sped up with parallel programming, in this project we will implement ICP with CUDA. 

The program code is split into two parts, the ICP algorithm module and the visualization module. In the runtime, we first generate a random rotation and translation to transform the original point clouds, then shuffle the points and save the result to a csv file. Then the ICP module reads the files containing the original point cloud and the transform one. Then ICP does the calculation and saves the estimated transformation and recovered point cloud to two csv files. Finally, the visualization module reads files containing the original point cloud, the transformed one, and the recovered one, and visualizes all the three point clouds. If there is no GUI on the machine, the visualization module can be skipped.

## 1. Setup
Conda is recommended to config this repo, more details about Miniconda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
### 1.1 Setup python evironment
```shell
conda create --name gpu_proj python=3.6
conda activate gpu_proj
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 1.2 Setup C++ evironment
To build this project in command line, cmake is required, https://cmake.org/download/, after downloading Cmake, don't forget to add its path to `PATH` variable.
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
For Mac Users, CLion is recommended for debugging CPU part.


## 2. Demo
If you have a GUI, simply run
```shell
python demo.py
```

If you don't have a GUI, first we run the C++ module to get ICP result (Not recommended)
```shell
./build/registration
```
Then we copy the files and run the python code to visualize the result

## 3. Configure Workspace
Nsight Eclipse is the default and best IDE to debug CUDA applications as far as I know. It also works perfectly with nvprof to show the porfiling results. The following steps show how to import this project into Nsight Eclipse

### 3.1 Prepare Directory 
```shell
cd .. && mkdir icp_build && cd icp_build
cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -D USE_VDEC=0 ../icp/
```

Now start up Eclipse and do the following to import the project.
* File→Import...
* General→Existing Projects into Workspace
* For the root directory enter the build root directory, not the source root
Leave other options unchecked and click Finish

### 3.2 Compilation 
First, compile the programs in `icp_build`

```shell
    make
```
Then you have to tell Eclipse what binary to run and what project to compile.

* Go to Run → Run Configurations...
* Double click on C/C++ Application to create a new configuration.
* Browse to the NG executable (build/src/NightshadeNG) for the Application field.
* Browse to select the NG project for the Project field.

### 3.3 Debugging
* Set up a debugging configuration in Eclipse.
* Be sure to manually add the actual source directory in the source tab as a local filesystem path.
* Add source paths to shared library code also so you can step through those.

Then, enjoy the IDE.

## 4. Nvidia Profiling
It seems that by default, non-root user don't have permision to profile GPU. If you can't profile, please try the followings:

### 4.1 Unload Old modules
```shell
systemctl isolate multi-user # Stop the window manager.
sudo modprobe -r nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm nvidia
# modprobe -r nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm nvidia_modeset nvidia-vgpu-vfio nvidia # Unload dependent modules
```

### 4.2 Allow all users to profile
```shell
sudo modprobe nvidia NVreg_RestrictProfilingToAdminUsers=0
```

### 4.3 Restart Windows Manager(GUI)
```shell
systemctl isolate graphical
```
